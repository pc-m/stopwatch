A precise, efficient stopwatch command line application.

# Build it

```
make
```

All you need is `make`, a C compiler and the libc development files. I've only
compiled it on Linux, but I believe it is currently POSIX.1-2001 compliant. I
might be wrong. Who cares.


# Run it

```
./stopwatch
```
