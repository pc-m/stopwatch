# stopwatch

A precise, efficient stopwatch command line application.

It's currently in development. But it's usable. After all, it's just a stopwatch.

## Build it

```
make
```

All you need is `make`, a C compiler and the libc development files. I've only compiled it on Linux,
but I believe it is currently POSIX.1-2001 compliant. I might be wrong. Who cares.


## Run it

```
./stopwatch
```
